# Notes_For_Macroeconomic_Analysis
This a series of training notes for macroeconomic analysts who are practioners (such as analysts in banks, hedge funds, prop shops) or market observers. All notes are written by myself.

We all know there is a huge gap between textbook macroeconomics and practioning macreconomics, the latter is even esoteric for a new economics graduate. However, textbook knowledge are fundemental skills before any meaning macroeconomic analysis can be formulated. 

# Prerequisite
It's perfectly alright if you do not have any formal economic education. I have seen the group of analysts with a wide range of educational backgroud, however they all walked through intermediate level textbooks by themselves. Here are recommendations of textbooks for new recruits. 
1. Principles of Economics, Gregory Mankiw
2. Microeconomic Theory: Basic Principles and Extensions, Walter Nicholson
3. Macroeconomics: Williamson
